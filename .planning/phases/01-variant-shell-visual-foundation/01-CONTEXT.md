# Phase 1: Variant Shell & Visual Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Register the happy variant at happy.worldmonitor.app with a warm, bright dashboard shell. Deliver correct branding (title, favicon, OG tags), a warm basemap, positive color system, and welcoming typography. No content panels yet — this is the visual foundation that all future phases build on.

## Implementation Decisions

### Color palette & mood
- Overall vibe: **Calm & serene** — soothing, quiet optimism, not loud or playful
- Base background: **Off-white / cream** (#FAFAF5-ish) — warm, paper-like, content panels float on it
- Accent colors: **Sage green + gold** — muted sage for primary actions, warm gold for highlights and emphasis
- Semantic color system: Greens, golds, soft blues throughout — no dark military aesthetic
- **Both light and dark modes from the start** — dark mode uses warm dark tones (deep navy, dark sage) instead of pure black

### Map basemap style
- Style: **Soft vector / minimal** — clean vector map with muted colors, simplified shapes, minimal labels (think Apple Maps light mode but warmer)
- Colors: **Sage landmass, light blue ocean** — muted sage/olive land, very light blue ocean, subtle gray borders
- Detail level: **Match WorldMonitor's existing level** — same zoom detail, just with the warm style applied
- Grid/graticule: **Claude's discretion** — decide based on what looks best with the soft vector style

### Typography & branding
- Body font: **Rounded sans-serif** — soft, approachable letterforms (Nunito, Quicksand direction). Friendly without being childish
- Headings: **Same family, bolder weight** — semibold/bold of the same rounded sans-serif. Unified feel, not a second font
- Favicon: **Warm-colored globe** — small globe icon in sage/gold tones, connects to "world monitor" concept in the happy palette
- Logo treatment: **Claude's discretion** — design the header logo/logotype that best fits the calm/serene direction

### Panel chrome & layout feel
- Shape language: **Soft rounded corners** — generously rounded (12-16px radius). Panels feel gentle, approachable
- Elevation: **Subtle shadow elevation** — panels float slightly above the cream background with soft shadows. Depth without heaviness
- Empty states: **Soft illustration + message** — simple, warm line illustrations (nature-themed) with friendly text like "Coming soon"
- Layout structure: **Same grid as WorldMonitor, new skin** — variant differs in theme/mood, not panel arrangement

### Claude's Discretion
- Map graticule presence and styling
- Logo/logotype design for the header
- Exact color hex values within the sage green + gold + cream direction
- Dark mode specific adjustments (exact dark tones)
- Loading skeleton and transition animations
- Specific illustration style for empty states

## Specific Ideas

No specific external references given — open to standard approaches within the calm/serene, sage-green-and-gold direction. The key constraint is: it should feel like the visual opposite of WorldMonitor's dark military aesthetic while maintaining the same spatial layout and detail level.
